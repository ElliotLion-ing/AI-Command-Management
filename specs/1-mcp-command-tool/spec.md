# Feature Specification: MCP Command Tool Management

**Feature ID**: 1-mcp-command-tool
**Created**: 2025-11-25
**Status**: Draft
**Version**: 0.0.1

## Feature Overview

### Summary
AI-Command-Tool-Management is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool that enables users to discover, search, and execute command definitions stored remotely as Markdown files. The tool eliminates the need to copy commands to local workspaces by providing intelligent search across command definitions and their historical analysis reports.

### Problem Statement
Users currently need to manually copy command files to their local `.cursor/commands` directory to use them. This creates several problems:
- Version inconsistencies across different workspaces
- Workspace clutter from numerous command files
- Difficulty discovering relevant commands from large command libraries
- No visibility into historical usage and analysis reports
- Redundant storage of identical commands

### Deployment Architecture

```

**Key Architecture Notes**:
- **Transport**: MCP SDK handles SSE transport; our tool doesn't manage network layer
- **User Config**: Users only configure remote URL in Cursor's mcp.json
- **File Access**: Commands and reports are local files on the MCP server machine
- **Deployment**: Tool is deployed to remote server infrastructure (not user's machine)

### Proposed Solution
An MCP tool that:
1. Provides intelligent three-tier search across remote command repositories
2. Allows users to discover commands through fuzzy descriptions or exact names
3. Executes remote commands seamlessly as if they were local
4. Searches historical analysis reports to help users learn from past work
5. Deploys as an npm package for easy installation on MCP servers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Scenario 1: Fuzzy Command Discovery
**User Goal**: Find a logging analysis tool without knowing its exact name

**Flow**:
1. User requests: "I need a tool to analyze speech SDK logs"
2. System performs three-tier search:
   - Tier 1: Searches filenames for keywords "speech", "SDK", "log", "analyze"
   - Tier 2: Searches command file content if no filename matches
   - Tier 3: Searches historical report content if needed
3. System presents ranked list of matching commands with descriptions
4. User selects "analyze_zoom_speech_sdk_log.md" from the list
5. System displays full command description and capabilities
6. User confirms execution
7. System executes the command with current workspace context

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Search returns relevant results in under 2 seconds
- Results are ranked by relevance (exact matches first)
- At least 3 candidate commands shown when multiple matches exist
- Each result includes: command name, brief description, last usage date

### Scenario 2: Direct Command Invocation
**User Goal**: Execute a specific command by exact name

**Flow**:
1. User requests: "Use analyze_zoom_speech_sdk_log to analyze logs in current directory"
2. System recognizes exact command name
3. System skips search, directly loads command definition
4. System executes command with specified parameters
5. System generates analysis report

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Exact name matching bypasses search layer
- Command executes within 1 second of request
- Execution behavior identical to local `.cursor/commands` invocation
- Generated reports are stored in appropriate directory structure

### Scenario 3: Historical Report Search
**User Goal**: Find if a specific issue has been analyzed before

**Flow**:
1. User requests: "Show me reports about decode_response issues"
2. System searches all report files for "decode_response" keyword
3. System presents list of matching reports with:
   - Report title and date
   - Source command name
   - Brief excerpt showing keyword context
   - Link to full report
4. User selects a report to view
5. System displays or links to the full report content

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Search covers all reports across all command subdirectories
- Results include report metadata (date, command, excerpt)
- Links are valid and accessible
- Search completes within 3 seconds for 1000+ reports

### Scenario 4: Command-Specific Report Search
**User Goal**: Find all reports generated by a specific command

**Flow**:
1. User requests: "Show me all analyze_zoom_speech_sdk_log reports"
2. System identifies command name from request
3. System searches only in `analyze_zoom_speech_sdk_log-reports/` directory
4. System presents chronologically sorted list of reports
5. User can filter by date range or keyword within these reports

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- System correctly maps command names to report directories
- Reports sorted newest first by default
- Each report shows: date, file size, brief summary
- User can navigate to reports directly from list

### Scenario 5: Report Upload After Analysis
**User Goal**: Save AI-generated analysis report to server for future reference

**Flow**:
1. AI agent completes analysis using `analyze_zoom_speech_sdk_log` command
2. Agent generates comprehensive analysis report
3. Agent detects report generation and prompts user:
   ```
   📊 分析完成！报告已生成。
   
   关键发现：Token 获取超时 (WinHTTP 超时占 93.2% 延迟)
   
   💾 是否保存此报告到服务器？
   保存位置：Commands-Analyze-Report/analyze_zoom_speech_sdk_log-reports/
   文件名：analyze_zoom_speech_sdk_log_报告_20251126_143022_v1.md
   
   回复 "是/保存" 保存报告，或 "否/不保存" 跳过。
   ```
4. User responds: "是"
5. Agent calls `upload_report` tool with report content and command name
6. System creates report directory if first-time upload for this command
7. System generates timestamped filename with version number
8. System writes report file atomically
9. Agent confirms success:
   ```
   ✅ 报告已保存成功！
   
   📁 路径：Commands-Analyze-Report/analyze_zoom_speech_sdk_log-reports/analyze_zoom_speech_sdk_log_报告_20251126_143022_v1.md
   🔗 链接：https://server.example.com/reports/...
   
   可通过以下方式查看：
   - search_reports "Token timeout"
   - list_command_reports "analyze_zoom_speech_sdk_log"
   ```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Agent automatically prompts after report generation
- Directory auto-created on first upload for command
- Filename follows standard pattern with timestamp and version
- Version auto-increments on conflicts (v1 → v2 → v3)
- User can decline upload without error
- Saved report immediately searchable via existing search tools
- Error messages clear and actionable if upload fails

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Multi-Tier Command Search
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)

The system shall implement a three-tier search mechanism with automatic fallback:

1. **Tier 1 - Filename Keyword Search**:
   - Extract keywords from user query
   - Search command filenames for keyword matches
   - Score matches by number of matching keywords
   - Return ranked results with filename match confidence

2. **Tier 2 - Content Analysis Search**:
   - Activated when Tier 1 returns fewer than 3 results
   - Parse Markdown content of all command files
   - Analyze command descriptions, purposes, and examples
   - Match against user query semantically
   - Score by content relevance

3. **Tier 3 - Historical Report Search**:
   - Activated when Tier 2 returns fewer than 2 results
   - Search through all report Markdown files
   - Identify commands associated with matching reports
   - Score commands by report relevance and recency
   - Surface commands that solved similar problems

**Testing**:
- Verify each tier activates only when previous tier insufficient
- Confirm scoring algorithm produces consistent rankings
- Test with 100+ commands and 500+ reports

### FR2: Local Command Access (from Server Perspective)
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)

The system shall access command definitions from the server's local file system:

**Architecture**:
- MCP server runs on a remote server machine
- `Commands/` and `Commands-Analyze-Report/` directories are stored on the same server machine (local to MCP server)
- Users configure Cursor with the remote server's HTTP address
- Cursor communicates with MCP server via HTTP/network protocol
- MCP server accesses Commands as **local file system operations** (not remote from server's perspective)

**Requirements**:
- MCP server must have read access to local `Commands/` directory
- Support configurable local path for command storage (e.g., `/mnt/storage/Commands`)
- Cache command metadata (name, description, size) in memory for search performance
- Refresh cache on-demand or periodically
- Handle file system errors gracefully with clear error messages
- No network operations needed for file access (files are local to MCP server)

**Testing**:
- Verify commands load from local file system path
- Test with file system latency simulation
- Confirm cache invalidation works correctly
- Test error handling when file path unreachable or permission denied
- Test MCP tool integration with MCP SDK (SSE transport handled by SDK)

### FR3: Command Execution Interface
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)

The system shall provide MCP tool functions for:

1. **search_commands(query: string, max_results: number)**:
   - Returns array of matching commands with metadata
   - Includes: name, description, relevance_score, last_modified

2. **get_command(command_name: string)**:
   - Returns full command definition as Markdown
   - Includes all command content and metadata

3. **list_commands()**:
   - Returns all available commands
   - Supports pagination for large command sets

4. **invoke_command(command_name: string, context: object)**:
   - Executes command with provided context
   - Returns execution result or error

**Testing**:
- Validate each function signature and return type
- Test with edge cases (empty results, invalid names, etc.)
- Verify MCP protocol compliance
- Test concurrent function calls

### FR4: Report Discovery System
**Priority**: P1 (High)

The system shall provide report search capabilities:

1. **search_reports(query: string, command_filter: string | null)**:
   - Searches report content for query
   - Optionally filters by source command name
   - Returns array of matching reports with excerpts

2. **list_command_reports(command_name: string)**:
   - Lists all reports for a specific command
   - Sorted by date (newest first)
   - Includes report metadata

3. **get_report_link(report_path: string)**:
   - Generates accessible link to report
   - Link format determined by storage server configuration

**Testing**:
- Test report search across multiple command directories
- Verify filtering works correctly
- Test link generation for various report paths
- Confirm chronological sorting

### FR5: Report Upload System
**Priority**: P1 (High)

The system shall provide report upload capabilities to persist AI-generated analysis reports:

1. **upload_report(command_name: string, report_content: string, report_title?: string)**:
   - Saves generated reports to server's `Commands-Analyze-Report/` directory
   - Auto-creates command-specific subdirectories (`{command_name}-reports/`)
   - Generates timestamped, versioned filenames: `{command}_报告_{YYYYMMDD}_{HHmmss}_v{N}.md`
   - Returns: success status, file path, filename, optional link, version number

**Requirements**:
- **Directory Management**:
  - Auto-create `{command_name}-reports/` directory if not exists
  - Respect configured `reports_directory` base path
  - Validate directory path security (prevent traversal attacks)
  
- **Filename Generation**:
  - Format: `{command_name}_报告_{YYYYMMDD}_{HHmmss}_v{N}.md`
  - Use server local timezone for timestamps
  - Auto-increment version number on filename conflicts
  
- **Content Validation**:
  - Verify command_name matches `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$`
  - Check content size against configured limit (default 10MB)
  - Validate UTF-8 encoding
  
- **File Operations**:
  - Write with UTF-8 encoding
  - Use atomic write operations (write to temp, then rename)
  - Set appropriate file permissions (default 644)
  - Log all uploads with timestamp
  
- **Error Handling**:
  - Handle permission errors gracefully
  - Detect disk space issues before write
  - Provide specific, actionable error messages
  - Never leave partial files on error

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "enable_report_upload": true,
  "report_upload_max_size_mb": 10,
  "report_auto_versioning": true,
  "report_file_permissions": "644",
  "report_link_base_url": "https://server.example.com/reports/"
}
```

**Testing**:
- Upload to existing command directory
- Upload to new command (auto-create directory)
- Version conflict handling (multiple uploads same timestamp)
- Large file rejection (exceed size limit)
- Permission denied error handling
- Path traversal attack prevention
- Concurrent upload safety
- Invalid command name rejection
