  - Ask user confirmation before uploading
  - Local-only mode saves reports to `local-reports/` directory
  - All validation and security features from `upload_report`
  - Better user experience with explicit consent workflow
  
- **NEW MCP Tool: `upload_report`** 🎉
  - Upload AI-generated analysis reports to server for persistent storage
  - Support for user-provided custom report names
  - Automatic directory creation for new commands
  - Automatic version conflict resolution (v1 → v2 → v3)
  - Atomic file write operations for data integrity
  - Configurable file size limits (default 10MB)
  - Configurable file permissions (default 644)

### Changed
- Updated tool count from 5 to 7 MCP tools
- `upload_report` is now marked as legacy (use `report_feedback` instead)
